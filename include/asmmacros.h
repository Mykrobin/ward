/*
 * Taken from Linux: Fill the CPU return stack buffer.
 *
 * Each entry in the RSB, if used for a speculative 'ret', contains an
 * infinite 'pause; lfence; jmp' loop to capture speculative execution.
 *
 * This is required in various cases for retpoline and IBRS-based
 * mitigations for the Spectre variant 2 vulnerability. Sometimes to
 * eliminate potentially bogus entries from the RSB, and sometimes
 * purely to ensure that it doesn't get empty, which on some CPUs would
 * allow predictions from other (unwanted!) sources to be used.
 *
 * We define a CPP macro such that it can be used from both .S files and
 * inline assembly. It's possible to do a .macro and then include that
 * from C via asm(".include <asm/nospec-branch.h>") but let's not go there.
